        <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
        <p> Okay, so this is the only bit of mandatory theory. In order to begin to write HTML, it helps if you know
            what
            you are writing.

            HTML is the language in which most websites are written. HTML is used to create pages and make them
            functional.

            The code used to make them visually appealing is known as CSS and we shall focus on this in a later
            tutorial. For now, we will focus on teaching you how to build rather than design.

        <h2 body style="text-align: left;">What are Tags and Attributes?</h2>
        <p>Tags and attributes are the basis of HTML.

            They work together but perform different functions – it is worth investing 2 minutes in differentiating the
            two.

        </p>
        <h2>What Are HTML Tags?</h2>
        <p>Tags are used to mark up the start of an HTML element and they are usually enclosed in angle brackets. An
            example of a tag is: &#60; h1 &#62
            <br>

            Most tags must be opened &#60; h1 &#62and closed &#60; h1 &#62 in order to function.

            </p>
        <h2>What are HTML Attributes?</h2>
        <p>Attributes contain additional pieces of information. Attributes take the form of an opening tag and additional info is placed inside.

            An example of an attribute is:
            
            >&#60; img src="mydog.jpg" alt="A photo of my dog." &#62
            
            In this instance, the image source (src) and the alt text (alt) are attributes of the &#60; img &#62 tag.
          
            <br>

            Most tags must be opened &#60; h1 &#62and closed &#60; h1 &#62 in order to function.
